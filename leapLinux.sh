You've washed ashore after your ship was wrecked in a digital storm.
Captain Shellbeard's treasure is hidden somewhere on this island!

üéØ YOUR FIRST CHALLENGE:
Find the hidden scroll that contains the first piece of the treasure map!

üí° HINT: Some files like to hide... they start with a special character.
Use 'ls -la' to see ALL files, including hidden ones!

Commands you'll need:
- pwd (where am I?)
- ls (what's here?)  
- ls -la (show hidden files too!)
- cat filename (read a file)

Combine them well to find where next to start!"

üìç CLEAR DIRECTION: Go to the jungle folder
üí° Command: cd ../jungle

üåø WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE! üåø

You've found the pirate camp! The ancient map has been torn into pieces.

üéØ YOUR CHALLENGE:
1. List all map pieces: ls map_piece*
2. Combine them in order: cat map_piece_*.txt > complete_map.txt  
3. View your assembled map: cat complete_map.txt
4. Count the lines: wc -l complete_map.txt (answer should be 5)
5. Make a backup: cp complete_map.txt map_backup.txt

When you see where the map points, you'll know where to go next!

üó∫Ô∏è MAP ASSEMBLED SUCCESSFULLY!

Your complete map shows an arrow pointing to the CAVE!
This is where the pirate's diary reveals the next secret.

üìç CLEAR DIRECTION: Navigate to the cave  
üí° Command: cd ../cave
üéØ Mission: Find and search the pirate's diary for "golden" clues!

Day 4: Discovered a cache of golden doubloons, getting warmer!
Day 5: The waterfall near the mountain echoes with mysterious sounds

üïØÔ∏è WELCOME TO THE MYSTERIOUS CAVE! üïØÔ∏è

You've found Captain Redbeard's personal diary from decades ago!
He was also searching for the golden penguin treasure!

üéØ YOUR CHALLENGE:
1. Search for "golden": grep golden pirates_diary.txt
2. Count golden mentions: grep -c golden pirates_diary.txt (should be 8)
3. Find the penguin day: grep penguin pirates_diary.txt (Day 7!)
4. Search multiple words: grep -E "golden|mountain" pirates_diary.txt

The diary reveals the golden penguin's location and your next destination!

1. Start the ghost: ./summon_ghost.sh
2. Find the ghost process: ps aux | grep "ghost_pirate"  
3. Or use: ps aux | grep sleep
4. Note the PID (Process ID number)
5. Banish the ghost: kill [PID]
6. Verify it's gone: ps aux | grep "ghost_pirate"

They speak of a CODED MESSAGE by the river that holds the key to finding
the golden penguin's final resting place.

üåä WELCOME TO THE MYSTICAL RIVER! üåä

You've discovered an ancient cipher left by Captain Shellbeard himself!
The message is encoded - words are in reverse order, separated by colons.

üéØ YOUR CHALLENGE:
1. View the cipher: cat cipher.txt
2. Replace colons with spaces: cat cipher.txt | tr ':' ' '
3. Reverse word order: cat cipher.txt | tr ':' ' ' | awk '{for(i=NF;i>=1;i--) printf "%s ", $i; print ""}'
   
Alternative method:
cat cipher.txt | tr ':' '\n' | tac | tr '\n' ' '

When decoded correctly, the message should read:
"YOU MUST FIND THE GOLDEN PENGUIN"

This confirms your ultimate quest!

    # Clear next destination clue

üåä CIPHER DECODED!

But first, you must prove your worthiness by unlocking the sealed treasure chest!
This chest is protected by ancient permission spells.

üìç CLEAR DIRECTION: Return to the mountain base
üí° Command: cd ../mountain/base

Congratulations! By mastering file permissions, you've proven worthy!

üóùÔ∏è  THE FINAL SECRET REVEALED:
Captain Shellbeard's Golden Penguin lies hidden in the most sacred place:

üìç EXACT LOCATION: .secret_location/ancient_waterfall
üíé HIDDEN FILE: .golden_penguin

üéØ FINAL QUEST STEPS:
1. Navigate to the base directory: cd ../../..
2. Go to the secret location: cd .secret_location/ancient_waterfall  
3. Look for hidden files: ls -la
4. Claim your prize: cat .golden_penguin

The legendary treasure awaits you at the ancient waterfall!

üè∞ THE PERMISSION PALACE üè∞

Before you lies a treasure chest sealed by ancient permission magic!
Only one who masters the chmod command can open it.

üéØ YOUR CHALLENGE:
1. Check current permissions: ls -l treasure_chest.txt
   You'll see: ---------- (no permissions at all!)
   
2. Grant read permission: chmod +r treasure_chest.txt
   OR use numeric: chmod 444 treasure_chest.txt
   
3. Verify permissions changed: ls -l treasure_chest.txt
   Should now show: r--r--r--
   
4. Read the treasure: cat treasure_chest.txt
